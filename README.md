🧠 **Smart Task Scheduler with AI Integration**

The Smart Task Scheduler is a real-world productivity solution that uses AI to intelligently manage and prioritize daily tasks. Built using Python with **Tkinter for GUI**, **SpaCy for NLP**, and **SQLite** for persistent storage, this system automatically categorizes and schedules tasks based on urgency, type, and user preferences.

The AI component, powered by SpaCy, analyzes natural language inputs to determine task intent and context, allowing for automated classification and smart sorting. With a clean, responsive interface, users can add, edit, delete, and filter tasks effortlessly. The system supports multi-threaded processing to ensure smooth interaction even during background operations like reminders or data updates.

This project demonstrates how AI can be seamlessly integrated into day-to-day applications to improve efficiency, decision-making, and user experience in task management scenarios. Ideal for students, professionals, and anyone looking to boost productivity with minimal manual effort.
